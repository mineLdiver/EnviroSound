# EnviroSound [b1.7.3]

### This is severely bugged at this point. It will be fixed later.

A Minecraft mod that provides realistic sound attenuation, reverberation, and absorption through blocks.

This is a fork of a fork of a fork of a fork of a fork of a fork!
I forked it from mysterywave who forked it from alkcorp who forked it from AfterRebellion who forked it from djpadbit who forked it from Daipenger who forked it from SonicEther.
Daipenger ported it to 1.12.2 and updated the mod, AfterRebellion just added some stuff, alkcorp improved it further while adding even more features, and mysterywave and I ported it to Beta 1.7.3.
