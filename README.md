# EnviroSound [b1.7.3]

### This is severely bugged at this point, it won't run. It will be fixed later.

A Minecraft mod that provides realistic sound attenuation, reverberation, and absorption through blocks.
Previously known as Sound-Physics, I decided the name was a tad bland for what it did. I renamed it to mark my fork distictively, as any features I add may or may not work at all. :)

This is a fork of a fork of a fork of a fork of a fork! I forked it from alkcorp who forked it from AfterRebellion who forked it from djpadbit who forked it from Daipenger who forked it from SonicEther. Daipenger ported it to 1.12.2 and updated the mod, AfterRebellion just added some stuff & I've decided to improve it further while adding even more features.  
 
* Dynamic environment evaluation (disabled by default, configured by in-game mod config)
* Automatic stereo to mono down-mixing of sounds.
* Basic compatibility with mods.
* Server support (right position for entity, computronics sounds and higher distance before sound cutoff)
* Support for all mods. (WIP)
* Further back ported fixes from 1.12+ releases.
* Cake!
